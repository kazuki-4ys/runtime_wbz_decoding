# Runtime Wbz Decoding

This is a code extension of Mario Kart Wii.

Created based on [Cheese Mod Kart](https://github.com/SeekyCt/cheese-mod-kart) by [Seeky](https://github.com/SeekyCt).

It consists of custom [REL](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/REL) and [Gecko Code](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Cheat_Code) to load it.

Decodes [WBZ/WLZ](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/WBZ) to [U8](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/U8) when track data is loaded by game code.

This reduces the capacity of most tracks by 30-40% (when using [WLZ](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/WBZ)).

However, this feature requires `auto-add.arc` to be dumped by [RevoKart Dumper](https://github.com/kazuki-4ys/RevoKart_Dumper).
